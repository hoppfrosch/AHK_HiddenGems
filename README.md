#AHK-HiddenGems [![AutoHotkey](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-AutoHotkey-yellowgreen.svg)](https://autohotkey.com/)

This is a collection of AHK-snippets/-libraries/-functions/-scripts I found on the net which I found useful.

More documentation on the single items [can be found here](https://hoppfrosch.github.io/AHK_HiddenGems).

## Libraries
* **Filesystem**
 * [glob](/lib/HiddenGems/glob.ahk) - iterates the given path pattern, returning a list of matched directory 
* **Misc**
 * [GUID / UUID](/lib/HiddenGems/GUID.ahk) - calculates Globally Unique IDentifier (GUID) & Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID)
* **System**
 * [GetBinaryType](lib/HiddenGems/System/GetBinaryType.ahk) - Determines whether a file is an executable (.exe) file, and if so, which subsystem runs the executable file.

## Scripts
* **Window Management**
 * [EasyGlide](scripts/EasyGlide/EasyGlide.ahk) - Make the middle mouse button drag any window, in any internal point. Additionally, if you let go while dragging, the window will "glide"  for short distance, and even bounce off the edges of the screen.
 * [ThrowWindow](scripts/ThrowWindow/ThrowWindow.ahk) - Throw any window by dragging it with the middle mousebutton and releaseing it. The window will float around the monitor bouncing of the screen edges.
